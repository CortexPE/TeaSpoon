A Massive PocketMine-MP plugin designed and is aiming to extend PMMP's functionalities (Without completely changing it) to Make it more Vanilla-Like.

Contributions are very welcome :smile:<br />You may contribute by opening a Pull Request and if it has been proven to be correct & working, I'll surely merge it.

# Installation
Installation is easy, Just download the latest phar from my [Jenkins Build Server](http://cortexpe.xyz:8080/job/TeaSpoon/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/TeaSpoon.phar) or from [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/CortexPE/TeaSpoon/~) then drag and drop it to your ```./plugins/``` folder...

# Issue Reporting
 - ALWAYS use the [LATEST PocketMine-MP Build](https://jenkins.pmmp.io/job/PocketMine-MP/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/) to use this plugin
 - Remove any plugins that may interfere with TeaSpoon's current features (if the feature cannot be disabled in the config.yml file)
 - Including the "Steps to Reproduce" in the issue report would be really helpful in fixing bugs.
