A Massive PocketMine-MP plugin designed and is aiming to extend PMMP's functionalities (Without completely changing it) to Make it more Vanilla-Like.

I wouldn't provide any support for using other branches of the plugin. They're still under development and very experimental. I won't be held responsible for any damages or corruptions that occured by using unsupported branches.

A/N: If you don't like it / hate it, Then don't even bother using it. It's that simple... TeaSpoon was made for those who need it. :wink:

Contributions are very welcome :smile:<br />You may contribute by opening a Pull Request and if it has been proven to be correct & working, I'll surely merge it.

# Installation
Installation is easy, Just download the latest phar from [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/CortexPE/TeaSpoon/~) then put it to your ```./plugins/``` folder. Restart your server. And you're basically done.

# Issue Reporting
 - ALWAYS use the [LATEST PocketMine-MP Build](https://jenkins.pmmp.io/job/PocketMine-MP/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/) to use this plugin
 - Remove any plugins that may interfere with TeaSpoon's current features (if the feature cannot be disabled in the config.yml file)
 - Including the "Steps to Reproduce" in the issue report would be really helpful in fixing bugs.
 - To help me determine why the issue occurs, including the TeaSpoonDump from ```/bugreport``` lets me view all the necessary server information to easily determine incompatibility issues and mis-configuration issues. <sub>Privacy Concerns? You can check the code for yourself <a href="https://github.com/CortexPE/TeaSpoon/blob/master/src/CortexPE/commands/BugReportCommand.php">here</a> ;)</sub>
 - The only supported branch is PMMP's 'master' branch. Issues regarding other branches will be closed.

# FAQs
### MobAI:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, you can use [PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX) while disabling ```entities.register``` in TeaSpoon's Configuration File.
### Redstone System:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being worked on... :wink:
