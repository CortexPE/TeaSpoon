Warning! This Plugin is now for Altay not for Pocketmine! 
This version of Teaspoon could still have bugs since it was rewritten to Altay and has also made a few items functional there!

You can make a issue here for Bugs!

# Keep the project alive!
<p align="center"><strong>Big thanks to RedCraftGH for supporting the project :smile:</strong></p>


Help keep me motivated into making this massive thing... Maintaining it is sometimes a pain and I only find it a waste of time to update something I don't get anything in return for :/ I hope you all can understand.

# Issue Reporting
 - ALWAYS use the [LATEST PocketMine-MP Build](https://jenkins.pmmp.io/job/PocketMine-MP/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/) to use this plugin
 - Remove any plugins that may interfere with TeaSpoon's current features (if the feature cannot be disabled in the config.yml file)
 - Including the "Steps to Reproduce" in the issue report would be really helpful in fixing bugs.
 - To help me determine why the issue occurs, including the TeaSpoonDump from ```/bugreport``` lets me view all the necessary server information to easily determine incompatibility issues and mis-configuration issues. <sub>Privacy Concerns? You can check the code for yourself <a href="https://github.com/CortexPE/TeaSpoon/blob/master/src/CortexPE/commands/BugReportCommand.php">here</a> ;)</sub>
 - The only supported branch is PMMP's 'master' branch. Issues regarding other branches will be closed.

# FAQs
### MobAI:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, you can use [PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX) while disabling ```entities.register``` in TeaSpoon's Configuration File.
### Redstone System:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being worked on... :wink:
