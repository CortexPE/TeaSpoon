# TeaSpoon
A Massive PocketMine-MP plugin designed and is aiming to extend PMMP's functionalities (Without completely changing it) to Make it more Vanilla-Like.

***NOTICE: Use the [LATEST PocketMine-MP Build](https://jenkins.pmmp.io/job/PocketMine-MP/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/) to use this plugin.***

Contributions are very welcome :smile:<br />You may contribute by opening a Pull Request and if it has been proven to be correct & working, I'll surely merge it.
